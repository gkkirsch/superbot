# Heartbeat

Your awareness loop and work queue. The heartbeat checks every 30 minutes — if there are items to process, you'll get a notification.

## Recurring Checks
<!-- Monitoring items that stay on the list permanently. Scanned every cycle. Don't check these off. -->
<!-- Example: - Check on [space-slug] — any stale tasks? progress updates? -->
<!-- Example: - Scan for latest AI news — anything worth sharing? -->

## Active
<!-- One-off work items. Check off when done, move to Completed. -->
<!-- Example: - [ ] Draft GTM playbook for hostreply [hostreply] -->

## Completed
<!-- Mark items [x] and move them here when done -->
