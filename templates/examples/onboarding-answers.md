## Section 2: About the User

**Question**: What describes you? What do you spend the most time doing? What are you currently passionate about? What do you wish you could learn?

> I am super excited about claude code, and have been trying to build a following on X around claude code and ai agents. I am also passionate about building projects with AI — I get that creative dopamine from having AI build something for me so quickly. I have built recently hostreply.ai, superchargeclaudecode.com, and a bunch of other projects scattered around in ~/dev and ~/dev/personal. I am excited about building agents that are proactive and I want to automate a lot of things in my life and help others do the same. I hope to have AI also help me in my personal life — reminding me to take care of my family and be a better person, yearn for uncomfortable life and do hard things.

**Follow-up question** (prying deeper based on above):

> The things I want to automate is getting help managing my X profile, finding posts to reply to, suggesting posts, researching the latest about Claude. There is a repo out there that has all the latest prompts from Claude Code — I forget what it is but I think that could be helpful. Also X is where everything is released about AI. I want help with go-to-market with hostreply.ai, doing outreach via Facebook, etc. I want to figure out how to sell my skills as an AI specialist and take on extra work on the side. I work for Podium.com on their AI team full-time. I just need to remember to be more present. I think just being scolded to take a break and live a more healthy life. Right now I just work all of the time — I rarely get up to take a break.
